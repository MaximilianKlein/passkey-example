# passkey example with server and frontend

The server code is in the root folder under `/src` the frontend is in `passkeys-example``

## running it locally

Setup is not very optimized. You can run

```bash
npm i
npm build # this will build the frontend code and place everything into the public folder
npm run dev # currently it is set up for https://passkey-mkl.onrender.com/ consider changing the origin
```
